# Bash Mastery

## Notes from a Course by Internet of Things Academy.

My notes didn't seem to evolve into anything helpful until
section 7, when I realized that this was a job for Jupyter Notebooks

My current version of VS Code supports not only Jupyter but also
runnable shell script code cells, an obvious boon.

The usual shebang script `#!/bin/bash`  will generate errors below these code cells, but the following code will work

``` bash
%%bash
```

That's it for now.
